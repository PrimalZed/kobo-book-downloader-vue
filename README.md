# How To Use
> [!WARNING]
> :construction: As an independently-made .exe without a paid signing certificate, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen may not recognize `kbd.exe` and share a warning when trying to run it. This can be surpassed by clicking `More Info`, followed by `Run Anyway`. Alternatively, you can download the source code and run it yourself with [Development instructions below](#development) (requires node/npm).

# TODO
* Replace pkg with node single executable app: https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html
  * Having trouble with all dependencies in single file during snapshot: depd throws 'callSite.getFileName is not a function'
    * Try webpack instead of rollup? Other rollup plugins to better encapsulate dependencies?
    * Maybe solve single-file issues with depd by dropping express? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Node_server_without_framework
* Electron instead of node.js web backend?
  * Not sure whether authentication would work
